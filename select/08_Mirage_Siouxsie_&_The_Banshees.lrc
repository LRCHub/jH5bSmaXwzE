[00:13.46] I'm just a vision on your TV screen
[00:19.17] Just something conjured from my dream
[00:25.67] Seen through your x-ray eyes, a see-through scene
[00:31.75] The image is no images, it's not what it seems
[00:54.75] 
[00:37.58] My limbs are like palm trees swaying in the breeze
[00:43.68] My body's an oasis to drink from as you please
[00:49.98] I'm not seeing what I'm meant to believe in
[00:52.93] Your non excuse for human being
[01:08.43] 
[01:09.53] It's quite plain to see that I'm playing with me
[01:15.59] A photo-fit of loose ends, framed in 3-D
[01:21.66] Seen through your x-ray eyes, a see-through scene
[01:27.72] The image is no images, it's not what it seems
[01:50.72] 
[01:33.87] My limbs are like palm trees swaying in the breeze
[01:39.82] My body's an oasis to drink from as you please
[01:46.06] I'm not seeing what I'm meant to believe in
[01:49.10] Your non excuse for human being, being, being
[02:11.60] 
[02:05.78] My limbs are like palm trees swaying in the breeze
[02:11.63] My body's an oasis to drink from as you please
[02:17.67] I'm not seeing what I'm meant to believe in
[02:20.86] Your non excuse for human being
[02:36.36] 
[02:26.81] It's not what it seems
[02:29.59] The image is no images
[02:32.14] It's not what it seems
[02:35.33] It's not what it seems
